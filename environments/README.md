# Execution environments

The `environments/` directory contains adapters used to obtain and prepare execution environments for NGI541 experiments.

Environment code is deliberately separated from benchmark methodology.

A benchmark workload should not need to know whether it is running locally, on manually allocated bare metal, or on CloudLab.

The intended structure is:

```text
environments/
├── common/
├── local/
├── baremetal/
└── cloudlab/
```

Directories should be introduced together with real implementation rather than as empty placeholders.

## `common/`

Shared host preparation and environment discovery used by more than one environment adapter.

Typical responsibilities include:

- dependency checks;
- system inventory collection;
- CPU topology discovery;
- ISA capability discovery;
- common server/client preparation;
- PMU availability checks;
- environment metadata capture.

## `local/`

Single-host development and preliminary evaluation.

The historical C2.1 HTTP/3 measurements belong to this environment class.

Local execution is useful for integration development and early performance signals, but it cannot provide the isolation required for canonical multi-node performance characterization.

## `baremetal/`

Preparation of manually allocated dedicated systems.

This adapter is intended for environments where machines already exist and NGI541 does not control infrastructure allocation.

## `cloudlab/`

CloudLab-specific provisioning and topology description.

The CloudLab profile belongs here rather than in `benchmark/` because CloudLab provides execution resources; it does not define benchmark semantics.

## Boundary

Environment adapters may configure operating-system and hardware execution conditions, including:

```text
CPU affinity
NUMA placement
frequency/governor policy
IRQ placement
network interfaces
system dependencies
performance-counter access
```

They must not silently change benchmark workload parameters or statistical analysis rules.

Every experiment must record the environment adapter and the resulting system inventory in its provenance.
